# pwds
My custom-made Password Manager, written in just one day after learning Rust.

This software utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cryptography to securely save data to a database file.

A password manager built with Rust, utilizing GTK4 for an intuitive and modern graphical interface.
