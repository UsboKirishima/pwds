## Running the Program with Rust

To run the program, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Rust and Cargo

First, you need to install Rust and Cargo on your system. You can download the installer from the official Rust website: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UsboKirishima/pwds.git

```bash
cargo run
```

This will compile the program and run it. You should see the graphical interface of the password manager.

### Step 5: Run the Program with Debug Mode

To run the program in debug mode, use the following command:

This will optimize the program for performance and disable debug logging.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the program, you can try the following:

* Check the console output for error messages.
